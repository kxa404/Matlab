%I am working with an image so videoreader, frames, etc. I cannot use. My working code is below (after import of image and making it grayscale)
%"sobelpic" is the name of the image.
%I'm getting an error that my subplot is too large. 
%I'm thinking that I need to manipulate my threshs (somehow?) because ultimately I need to choose "0.34" as a threshold value according to my professor.

threshs = 0.01:0.01:0.8;
   for i =1:length(threshs) 
    BW = im2bw(sobelpic,threshs(i));
    subplot(1,2,i); 
    imagesc(BW);
    title(['frame ',num2str(i)]);
   end
t = input('which threshold?');
BW = im2bw(sobelpic,threshs(t));
BW = imcomplement(BW);
